# [Boeing Speckle](https://boeing-speckle.herokuapp.com/) ‚úàÔ∏è

![Preview of Boeing Speckle Search](/public/images/preview.jpg?raw=true)
Boeing Speckle, short for Boeing Specification Cull, is an API that scrapes data from BAC specifications publicly available on the [Boeing D1-4426](http://active.boeing.com/doingbiz/d14426/index.cfm) for companies in the Boeing supply chain. Boeing Speckle allows users to query Boeing specifications by their BAC (document) number, and return related information including the document title, revision level, and revision date. The API is available as a GUI (graphical user interface) for quick access, or by making API calls to return a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) response.

# API Calls ‚òéÔ∏è

At this time, the API does not require an API key. Make requests by making http get requests to the desired URI.

URIs are relative to the hosting domain, currently: `https://boeing-speckle.herokuapp.com`

## Get all BAC specifications

Get all specifications in the database:

`/specs/`

## Get specification by BAC number

Get any specifications matching a given BAC number:

`/specs/BAC<number>`

Note that this will return any specifications matching the number provided. For example, a call to `/specs/BAC5307` would return a JSON object with data for `BAC5307` and `BAC5307-1`.

## Example Calls

`https://boeing-speckle.herokuapp.com/specs/`

`https://boeing-speckle.herokuapp.com/specs/BAC5321`

# Development ‚öôÔ∏è

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs), v14.17.0 (recommended) or higher
2. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), v7.21.1 (recommended) or higher
3. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)

## Install

Download the current codebase or create a fork. Navigate to the root of the project directory in your terminal window and call `npm install`. This will install the required node module dependencies into your project folder.

## Configure

Within MongoDB, create a new database called `specs`. Inside the database, create a new collection called `bac`.

From the root of the project directory, open `config.js`. Set the URI of the `specs` database using the format provided.

This will allow BAC specification data to be scraped and saved to the database, as well as searched by users using the API.

## Run

Next, call `node run dev-start-back`. This will start the backend server in development mode ([Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)). This will also scrape the Boeing D1-4426 for specifications and populate or update the database as necessary.

Then, open a new terminal window and navigate to the root of the project directory. Call `node run dev-start-front`. This will start the frontend server in development mode ([webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/)).

The previous call should open a browser window and navigate to `localhost:3000`. This is the project running locally on your machine. üéâüéâüéâ
